## About
This calculator was initially created as a small project for me to explore a new language. By creating this calculator, I was able to gain basic knowledge of HTML & CSS, while furthering my knowledge in JavaScript functions and its interactivity. In order to gain a better understanding of HTML, CSS & JavaScript, I decided to expand the idea of a simple calculator, to one with multiple functions. 
 
➤ This calculator has the ability to solve simple mathematical operations. Using basic operations, this calculator can calculate a variety of equations, ranging from addition to simple exponential expressions.
➤ Has the ability to convert units such as area, length, temperature, etc.
