# Calculator

## About
This calculator was initially created as a small project for me to explore a new language. By creating this calculator, I was able to gain basic knowledge of HTML & CSS, while furthering my knowledge in JavaScript functions and its interactivity. In order to gain a better understanding of HTML, CSS & JavaScript, I decided to expand the idea of a simple calculator, to one with multiple functions.
